# XR Valley

Welcome to XR Valley! We are a community dedicated to positioning Belgium on the global radar as an important contributor to the XR industry. Together with our members, partners and hubs weâ€™re building a strong XR ecosystem in Belgium to accelerate XR adoption benefiting the economy and society. We create opportunities for Industry, Policy Makers, Academics, and XR Solution Providers to connect, gain inspiration, and experience the transformative potential of XR technology in achieving diverse business or organizational goals. 

## Purpose of This Repository

This GitHub repository serves as a hub for our collaborative efforts. Here, we document our processes, share ideas, and conduct experiments aimed at integrating state-of-the-art solutions into real-world applications. Our approach is structured around two main components:

### 1. Challenge Exchange
- **Ideas:** Anyone with an idea for an experiment or potential advancement can share it quickly and informally. Contributors can upvote the ideas they like.
- **End Users:** Share their needs, ideas, and challenges.
- **Specialists and Solution Providers:** Assess the market for existing solutions and identify gaps, staying updated on market demands.
- **Outcome:** Based on the technology readiness of the identified use cases and the specialists' assessments, we determine the type of experiment required.

### 2. Experiments
- **Demonstrator:** A non-commercial effort to prove what is possible.
- **Feasibility Experiment:** Evaluates the complexity and budget needed to integrate state-of-the-art solutions into production flows.

These experiments often spark research projects, hackathons, or other innovative collaborations. Both end users and specialists benefit from this process:

- **End Users** are inspired by specialists' insights and the potential advancements showcased.
- **Specialists and Solution Providers** gain valuable market insights and enjoy the marketing benefits if their skills or products are utilized in Demonstrators or Feasibility Experiments.

## How to Get Involved

1. **Submit Ideas:** Share your innovative ideas in the Challenge Exchange section.
2. **Participate in Experiments:** Join us in conducting Demonstrators and Feasibility Experiments.
3. **Collaborate:** Engage with other community members to spark new projects and collaborations.

This collaborative approach not only addresses immediate needs but also drives continuous innovation and improvement. We look forward to your contributions and to advancing XR technologies together!
